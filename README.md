# ART FOR ALL (SERVER SIDE) 

## What is Art-for-All?

Art-for-All is a marketplace for Art lovers around the world. 

It allows you to share you artworks with afficionados and put them up for sale in our Gallery. You can edit and delete them at any time 

You can also buy an art piece from one of our users and find it in your Purchased Art History in your profile

This is the first app we built in React/node.js from scratch in only 5 days during our Ironhack Bootcamp
